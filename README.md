I need introduce myself to you, before my goals. I'm Hakkı Anıl Ragıboğlu, I'm living in Turkey and I'm 21 years old. I have experiences about 10 years in computers (about hacking and security tools), but I started to learn programming 2 years ago, in 2020. Now I have a dream and I'm working for this dream.
I have goals to do at this 5 years. My first goal is learning more english, but except this goal I have different goals as a programmer.

* I want to be a embedded system programmer, so I need to learn arm specific assembly, need more experience about c/c++ programming languages and need to learn rust programming language.

* I'm currently student in a university and my department is electrical-electronic engineering (In my country electric and electronic departments separate and united). So before I graduate I want do some big projects like about robotics, embedded terminal tools, some custom cpu's and compilers.

* I told you in first mark that I want to be a embedded system programmer. But also I want to be a pcb designer. So I will learn about design programs and maybe make one somthing like those programs.

* I'm an electrical-electronic engineer, so I will have knowledge about electric and electronics in the same time. Because of this there wil be a computer who designed and made by me. Because I can and I want to make.

* Also I will make side-projects for my purposes, so I can get experiences for my goals.

As you can see I'm a human who have dreams like you. Want to make something, want to improve itself and trying to be a good developer. So, if you had an issue or something like that, please leave an issue to issues sections.
